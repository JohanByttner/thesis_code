Code for implementing results in "Classifying RGB Images with multi-colour Persistent Homology"

The results from Adams is implemented in compute_persistence.py
The result from Hofer is implemented in slayer_network_rgb.py

To fix all dependencies, I have included setup.sh. Since the setup is highly system-dependent, this is a recommendation only and your mileage may vary.
